## July 8, 2026

### Completed
- Created the GitHub repository.
- Connected the project to Antigravity.
- Set up the initial folder structure.
- Made the first Git commit.

### Next Steps
- Design the project architecture.
- Implement webcam capture using OpenCV.
- Set up the Python backend.

### Notes
The goal is to build LensFlow as an AI-powered accessibility platform that enables hands-free computer interaction through computer vision and customizable hand gestures.

## July 8

### Completed
- Installed OpenCV
- Installed MediaPipe
- Installed NumPy
- Built the first camera module
- Successfully displayed live webcam feed

### Next
- Detect hand landmarks using MediaPipe

## Sprint 3 - Basic Gesture Recognition

### Completed
- Added GestureRecognizer class
- Implemented finger state detection
- Recognized Open Palm
- Recognized Fist
- Displayed gesture on webcam

### Learned
- MediaPipe landmarks
- Landmark coordinate comparison
- Basic rule-based gesture recognition

## Sprint 5 – Gesture Recognition Pipeline

### ✅ Completed
- Refactored project with `main.py` as the application entry point
- Added `GestureRecognizer` for gesture detection
- Added `GestureStabilizer` to prevent false triggers
- Implemented `ActionManager` for handling confirmed gestures
- Moved configurable values into `settings.py`
- Improved project architecture and modularity

### 📚 Learned
- Python package imports
- Modular software architecture
- Gesture stability (debouncing)
- Single Responsibility Principle
